The StarterSquad Organisation
===============

StarterSquad is a [worker cooperation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative) of free software developers.
Each worker member has equal rights in the decision making process. The decision process is based on consensus in a
[sociocratic](http://www.sociocracy.info/) manner. Decisions are not made by democratic vote, but based on arguments
and by leadership recognised with in a group of worker members. Thus the formation of focused teams is fundamental to
the health of the organisation.

StarterSquad Teams
----------------
The central organisational unit of StarterSquad is the team. Teams consist of 3 to 10 worker members, which self
organise around a prioritised backlog of work. The prioritisation of work is decided on by the team based on the
interests of the team members, its clients and other stakeholders identified by the team.

Clients
---------
Clients are external entities with demand for work that can be done by StarterSquad team(s). The client relationship is
established in three steps:

1. define and estimate the work
2. set the capacity needed
3. negotiate and execute a transaction that ensures a compensation for the delivered work

After the client relationship is established, the work can begin, until the capacity acquired in step 3 is depleted.

Workers
-----------

Team capacity can be delivered by different types of workers. Members, hired guns and employees. Roles are determined
by the worker members of the team based on the individual roles, merits, availabilities and preferences of the workers.
All workers relationships are between a single worker and exactly one team.

###Worker Members

A worker member is a person, fully dedicated to the StarterSquad organisation. This means that StarterSquad work takes
priority over other work at all times. Before joining the team as a worker member the worker has to go through a screening
process and be accepted by unanimous and anonymous vote by the existing worker members of the team. Worker members
share in the successes and failures of StarterSquad through dividend.

###Hired guns

A hired gun is an independent contractor that performs work to ensure capacity for a StarterSquad team, but is not
necessarily linked to the StarterSquad organisation in another way. Hired guns do not share in the successes and failures
of StarterSquad, unless they become investors too.

###Employees

Employees have the same rights as hired guns, and an employment contract in addition to that. Employment might often not
be a viable option.

###Guidelines

The following rules of thumb apply in relationships between workers and StarterSquad:

- StarterSquad prefers worker member relationships over hired guns over employee relationships.
- Capacity is a tradable resource, workers are not.
- Teams establish relationships with workers, StarterSquad establishes contracts

Other stakeholders
---------

This section describes other stakeholders than clients and workers. In the course of StarterSquad business other input
than work might be needed to serve the purposes of all stakeholders best. For example advisers, mentors and investors
can smoothen execution and delivery.

###Advisors, mentors

Like hired guns, advisors, mentors and coaches have no special role. StarterSquad's values are greatly supported by
interaction with external experts.

###Investors
