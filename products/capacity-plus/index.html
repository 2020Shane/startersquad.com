    <p>
      You are probably crystal clear on what the MVP for your start-up needs to be. But have you thought
      about what your potential customer’s problem really is, now and in the future?

      <p>If you do the work to
        identify what your customers really need, you can save time and money on creating features that aren’t
        needed in the initial phases, or at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Capacity Plus Deal teams you up with an expert on customer identification and validation, Lauren
        Valbert, who will work with you before and during the product development phase to ensure that MVP
        features, UX, and product roadmap are logical, validated, and impactful. The work includes a customer
        identification exercise, a set of key messages to test, and a round of message validation with the target
        customer.

      For an additional €500 per week for a minimum of 6 weeks during the MVP development, you get the
      following deliverables on top of the standard product design:
      <ul>
        <li>A customer assumptions document</li>
        <li>A set of product messages</li>
        <li>A mini-marketing plan to test the above two deliverables (through online surveys, focus groups
          or one-on-one interviews, depending on the product and target audience).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lauren also works directly with the StarterSquad project manager throughout the development process
        to ensure that the MVP development is in line with the conclusions from the above work.
