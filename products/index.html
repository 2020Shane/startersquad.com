          <h2>Technical Feasibility Scan</h2>

          <p>
            A solid technical foundation is crucial for the success of Internet Startups, particularly in product
            marketing. To mitigate technical
            implementation risk in product development StarterSquad performs <abbr title="Technical Feasibility Scans">TFS</abbr>. We will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>draw up a potential architecture;</li>
            <li>work with the client to define a <abbr title="Minimal Viable Product">MVP</abbr>;</li>
            <li><a href="/blog/startersquad-pricing-model/">estimate the amount of work</a>;</li>
            <li>identify technical risks such as: scalability, complexity or need for rare skills;</li>
            <li>make a draft design that you can use in early marketing and pitch decks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When investing in a new idea, there are business risks and technical risks. Financial investors ask would-be founders
            to scrutinize the business risks, but most <a href="/blog/the-need-for-technical-angels/">technical investors</a> are less experienced and fooled by the
            founders' enthusiasm. An investor should not rely on the founders’ technical team to identify risks early.

          <h2>Business Viability Scan</h2>

          <p>
            StarterSquad developed a methodology to check the viability of your startup or innovation idea.
            Our evidence-based approach checks if your startup has the marks found in the most successful Startups:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Idea: the idea is superb and will make headlines.</li>
            <li>Product/Market fit: your product will impress customers and there is a great market for your idea.</li>
            <li>Team and Execution: your team and you have the power to realize your dream both technically and commercially.</li>
            <li>Traction: the proof that your value proposition is appealing to customers.</li>
            <li>Social Proof: the proof that investors are interested and comparable startups are in business.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The <abbr title="Business Viability Scan">BVS</abbr> consists of a questionnaire, research and workshops with your Startup
            team. You'll get a report that helps growing your business and acquiring investment. This scan
            is often combined with the <abbr title="Technical Feasibility Scan">TFS</abbr> in technology-based Startups. These scans
            Lean Startup your Business.
