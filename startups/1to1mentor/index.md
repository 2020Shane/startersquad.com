If you are not well, that doesn't mean you should be unhappy. Sharing your story helps to accept and deal with your disease or disability. In three easy steps you can find someone like you, that knows what you are talking about in your neighborhood.

We built the front-end of InquisitHealth with AngularJS on top of an existing REST API.
In this project we managed to handle complex user interaction and interface logic with simple code.
Mostly thanks to the great directive support in Angular.
