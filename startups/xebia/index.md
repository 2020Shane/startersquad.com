Transforming from service company to product company.

### Products emerging from Services

Traditionally,
[Xebia is a high quality service company](http://xebia.com/en/content/xebia-services),
but in the course of delivering those services, products emerge that could be applied at other customers, or
used to attract new customers with similar problems. The potential of these products is hardly used.
A strong product marketing strategy is needed. StarterSquad delivers the online tools to market products.

### An online product Gallery

To solve the online marketing problem for Xebia, StarterSquad has custom built an online product Gallery.
On this gallery, a diverse set of products can be presented under a unified Xebia branded look and feel.
This does well to sell the products, it helps increase the Xebia brand value and it is a great tool for SEO.
