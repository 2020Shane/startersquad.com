          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>QwikSense approached StarterSquad for assistance with the development of&nbsp;a&nbsp;UI for their sensor. The idea was to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;slick front-end for demos, and a&nbsp;back-end for data processing.</p>

        <div class="6">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>StarterSquad created designs for the&nbsp;UI, focusing on&nbsp;the front-end first. After that, we&nbsp;built the back-end. An&nbsp;important milestone was the successful integration with the sensors, which was delivered in&nbsp;time for their first pilot implementation at&nbsp;the Municipality of&nbsp;Amersfoort. Working with their partner Empowering Management, StarterSquad helped them figure out what needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the MVP. In&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;assisted them with their marketing strategy and validated the concept with the right target audience. Finally, we&nbsp;coached them on&nbsp;building an&nbsp;internal technical team, while taking on&nbsp;the temporary role of&nbsp;the startup&rsquo;s CTO.</p>
