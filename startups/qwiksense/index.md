QwikSense is a Dutch startup that provides organizations with actionable sensor data and analytics that provide the right data to help them create a healthier working environment while saving energy.

### Problem

They originally approached StarterSquad to ask them to build a UI for the sensor, to create a slick front end for demos, and for back end data processing. It quickly became clear that they had a great idea, but lacked focus and clarity on what needed to be built.

### Solution

StarterSquad created designs of the UI, and focused on the frontend first. After that they also built the back end data processing. An important milestone was the integration with the sensors for their first pilot at the Gemeente Amersfoort. Together with their partner Empowering Management, StarterSquad helped them figure out what needed to be in the MVP, and helped QwikSense to create their marketing strategy and validate the concept with the target audience. StarterSquad also coached them on building an internal technical team, while taking on the temporary role of the CTO for the startup.

### Result

As a result of what was built by StarterSquad, QwikSense obtained seed funding, and it also helped them get into the Smart Energy program of the Rockstart accelerator in Amsterdam. QwikSense has also been able to deliver software and hardware for the Gemeente Amersfoort pilot, and obtain validation of their concept. The solution that StarterSquad helped build for QwikSense is now garnering a lot of interest from potential partners and clients.
