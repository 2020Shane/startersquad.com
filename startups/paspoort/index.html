        <p>The Lek en&nbsp;Ijssel school district is&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;17&nbsp;primary schools located in&nbsp;the Dutch cities of&nbsp;Ijsselstein, Lopik, Vianen, and Culemborg.</p>

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>The school district was tracking children&rsquo;s progress and creating individual learning schedules by&nbsp;keeping handwritten notes. But due to&nbsp;the large number of&nbsp;students, this system proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;highly impractical. It&nbsp;became too difficult to&nbsp;keep track of&nbsp;individual students and maintain the overall schedule. It&nbsp;was also impossible to&nbsp;allow children to&nbsp;add information to&nbsp;the system from home, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;involve their parents.</p>
          <p>The district attempted to&nbsp;digitize the process by&nbsp;buying off-the-shelf applications, but they could not get the children to&nbsp;adopt the new procedure. Then, they tried to&nbsp;work with a&nbsp;software company that wanted to&nbsp;charge them &euro;10,000 per school to&nbsp;implement a&nbsp;new system, but this solution was far too costly. Finally, they approached StarterSquad (whose founder had children in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the schools).</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>StarterSquad suggested building an&nbsp;online platform for the whole district, rather than a&nbsp;separate implementation for each school. We&nbsp;then hosted a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;workshops for children aged 7&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;create user stories and help them design the user experience themselves. This created a&nbsp;strong sense of&nbsp;involvement, resulting in&nbsp;the children&rsquo;s quick adoption of&nbsp;the system.</p>

        <p>The pilot platform was rolled out in&nbsp;the first school in&nbsp;June 2014. Since then, the project has been adopted by&nbsp;other schools and has been extremely well received by&nbsp;the school district&rsquo;s administration, the students and their parents.</p>
