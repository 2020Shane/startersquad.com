On the way back from StartupWeekend Timisoara, the founders of StarterSquad started playing with the idea of making guides simpler. Development started in the airport of Munich but they needed a bit more flesh on the design.

The StarterSquad community was involved and created a nice design and a landing page with a working PoC showing several guides. That gave enough feedback to see that there was interest and the product could be a success.

At this point the development is being funded and the product will see it's first public launched in Q4 2014.
