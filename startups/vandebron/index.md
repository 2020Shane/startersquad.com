Vandebron is a Dutch startup that empowers consumers to make their own educated decisions about their energy suppliers, by creating a trading platform connecting them directly with the energy producers, such as windmill owners.

### Problem

Republiq had a big idea, and a correspondingly big business plan, which started out too high-level. They were trying to get funding, but the potential investors they approached required them to get into more technical detail to secure an initial seed funding amount.

Republiq approached StarterSquad to help them in the fall of 2013. The founders’ two main questions initially were “what will the build cost?” and “can it be built in a couple of months?” They needed to convince investors that they had access to the right development capabilities, and that it could be done. They also needed an action plan, as they had had the idea for two years, and needed to start building.

### Solution

StarterSquad started by helping Republiq define first what features would be in the MVP. They performed a Technical Feasibility Scan, which provided Republiq with the answers they needed to provide to their investors quickly. It allowed Republiq to demonstrate that the platform build was possible, and could be done quickly. StarterSquad also provided a plan on how StarterSquad was going to build Republiq’s internal technical development team for them.

### Result

Vandebron.nl obtained the seed funding that they wanted at the end of 2013. They then returned to StarterSquad to hire them to build the MVP as quickly as possible. That was delivered in Q1 of 2014. After delivering the MVP, StarterSquad is taking care of hosting, maintenance, training. At this point Vandebron.nl is showing promising growth with thousands of customers.
