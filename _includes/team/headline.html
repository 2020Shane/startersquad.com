  <h1>The StarterSquad Team. Who we&nbsp;are</h1>
  <p>
    All members of StarterSquad share equally in the successes and failures of the team. There is no hierarchy, bosses.
    We all have different specialties and we're not afraid to rely on each other. We don't thrive on corporate structure,
    politics or covering our asses. Our clients get everything straight up, without spin, and we expect the same in
    return.
