          <h2>Early feedback to patients</h2>

          <p>
            Rehabilitation after an injury should be closely monitored by a medical specialist, for example a
            physiotherapist. Typically this happens with weekly sessions, but after a week of performing the exercise
            in the wrong way a lot of damage could be done.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be solved by regularly giving feedback on how the patient performs her exercises, but this is
            costly in the current setup of a physio therapist.
          </p>

          <h2>Asynchronous video chat</h2>
          <p>
            To solve this problem, <a href="http://wellpepper.com/">Wellpepper allows physio therapists to chat with patients</a>, using
            video messages and pictures they take on their mobile device. This allows patients to record their questions
            directly when doing the exercise, and it allows the physio therapist to respond during his day whenever he
            finds some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the chat application developed by StarterSquad, Wellpepper is running pilots at several US hospitals.
            Feedback is very positive.
