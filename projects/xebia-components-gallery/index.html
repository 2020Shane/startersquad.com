          <h2>QwikSense climate monitoring</h2>
          <p>Indoor climate is an important driving factor for productivity.
            It has a proven impact on reaction speed, learning ability, mood and intelligence.
            To help organizations improve this, QwikSense makes indoor climate quality quantifiable.
            Sensors are placed into offices and schools, then from the measured data easy to read results
            are presented in the clean user interface designed and implemented StarterSquad.</p>

          <h2>Application Architecture</h2>
          <p>The front-end was built in JavaScript (AngularJS), HTML5 and CSS3.
            It uses google maps and a custom built backend. The back-end was build using Scala and Spray
            on top of MongoDB and a third party API.
            The API integration uses Spray's http client support and spray-json to parse the output
            that is then converted to the clean REST API through an anti corruption layer.</p>
