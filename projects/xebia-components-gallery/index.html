            Traditionally,
            <a href="http://xebia.com/en/content/xebia-services">Xebia is a high quality service company</a>,
            but in the course of delivering those services, products emerge that could be applied at other customers, or
            used to attract new customers with similar problems. The potential of these products is hardly used.
            A strong product marketing strategy is needed. StarterSquad delivers the online tools to market products.
