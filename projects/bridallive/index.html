          <h2>Forrest Gump</h2>
          <p>
            The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel on which it is based,
            including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted. Filming took
            place in late 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
            Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate the protagonist into archived footage
            and to develop other scenes. A comprehensive soundtrack was featured in the film,
            using music intended to pinpoint specific time periods portrayed on screen. Its
            commercial release made it a top-selling soundtrack, selling over
            12 million copies worldwide.

          <h2>Who framed Roger Rabbit?</h2>
          <p>
            Robert Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film. Canadian animator Richard Williams was
            hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree
            Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming,
            the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer
            than expected.
