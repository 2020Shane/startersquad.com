          <h2>Front-end Architecture</h2>
          <p>We built the front-end of InquisitHealth with AngularJS on top of an existing REST API.
            In this project we managed to handle complex user interaction and interface logic with simple code.
            Mostly thanks to the great directive support in Angular.</p>
