          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>The school district was tracking children’s progress and creating individual learning schedules by keeping handwritten notes. This made the job of tracking and maintaining the overall progress and schedule impossible. It was also impossible to allow children to input to the system from home, or to involve the parents.</p>
          <p>The district attempted to digitize the process by first buying in off-the-shelf applications, but could not get the children to adopt the new procedure. They then tried to bring in a software company that wanted to charge them €10,000 per school to implement their solution. They finally approached StarterSquad (whose founder had children in one of the schools).</p>

        <div class="triptych-section">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>StarterSquad suggested building one online platform for the whole district, rather than a separate implementation for each school. The company then created a series of workshops for the children in the affected schools, aged 7 to 12, to help create user stories and design the user experience themselves! This had the effect of getting the children’s buy-in on the solution from the beginning.</p>

        <div class="triptych-section">
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>Everyone in the administration of the district and in the individual schools is on board with the project. Delivery of the pilot platform has been roled out to the first school in June 2014, the next schools will follow at the beginning of the following school year in September 2014.</p>
