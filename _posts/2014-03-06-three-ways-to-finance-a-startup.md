You have a great idea, a cool name in mind and the appropriate space for starting your personal
business— but unfortunately not enough cash and this one of the most common problems
encountered.

Investing in a small business, referring mostly to startups, is like a war fight on a crowded field
because of the large number of competitors (estimated 27.5 million small businesses only in
U.S.) and nearly 80% of them get their financing through bank loans and credits.
There is no secret that getting money through those avenues nowadays is a very difficult process,
but it is known that without a fight, you can’t expect to win. Sustain and finance your plan with
these methods:

##1. Bank loans

The U.S. Small Business Administration released a report in July that provided information
about lending to small business that have been declined for the past year. Business loans of less
than $100,000 decreased from $139.5 billion in 2011 to $138.2 in 2012. Business owners still
have to face roadblocks, referring to lending restrictions by banks, even the recession years have
past.

Community banks and credit unions are a viable choice to bet on, since they already have
avoided the housing crisis and often offer money to lend without the same high criteria as the
national banks. The key of obtaining the financial resources from this source is convincing the
lenders that you will make profit with your small business and be able to pay back the loan.
Another shot that you can make is taking advantage of non-profit organization, like credit
unions. These funding option offers you even better lending terms than commercial banks and
should not be ignored.

From frequent flier miles to discounts on automobiles, there is a program out there for everyone.
Many credit card companies offer incentive programs based on the amount of purchases you
make. When financing your business with a credit card, the main aspects to take in consideration
should be whether you can pay off the balance monthly and select the offer with the lowest
introductory interest rate. These offers allow you to move balances to lower-rate cards.

##2. Government assistance

It is known that nowadays the SBA (Small Business Administration) offers qualified analysis
and financial programs. Even it doesn’t loan money directly, the SBA sets guidelines especially for commercial loans with negotiated strings attached for cases of entrepreneurs that didn’t get
financing from the commercial banks.

But on the upside on the hill, SBA loans are planned with long terms and low down payments
and may come, in some cases, with pretty good interest rates. With advantages also come
disadvantages, such as many paperwork and waste of time, regarding the longer period of getting
the approval, compared with the loans received from private lenders.

##3. Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is a new financing method that came up recently and it has proved to be quite
effective, especially for businesses with a capital under $10.000. This methods popularity had
increased in the last years and the top sites for that are Indiegogo and Kickstarter. The main idea
is raising crowd money in return for token incentives like a prerelease product. With this
approach cuts out professional investors and brokers, giving a chance to regular people that are
trying to fulfil their needs and dreams.
