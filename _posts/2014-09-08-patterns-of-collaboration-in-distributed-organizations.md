StarterSquad is a team of remote developers distributed across different time-zones across all continents. While working in such a manner, we experienced and evolved certain patterns and practices on collaboration. Through a series of posts, we’ll share our experience. In this post, let’s talk about patterns and practices of remote collaboration.

###Remote Pairing
Agile software development has implicit value - team work. The focus is no more to finish individual goals but to work together towards achieving sprint goals . It’s easy to help each other and share knowledge through remote pairing. With abundance of tools available for screen share and for video conversation, it’s easy to work as remote pairs. We have been using remote pairing for last 7-8 years now and it works wonders for remote collaboration.

Remote pairing is the default practice to work for all of our teams

###Give a call for bigger conversations
For short communication, async messages work great as they are non-intrusive and you can reply once you have time. However for bigger conversations, async messages take more time to come to a conclusion. In such situations, use video/voice calls. The resultant of the discussion can be documented in form of transferable knowledge.

###Speak up to avoid misunderstanding
Async messages mean written messages which further mean combination of words. Not everybody is good at writing and choosing the right words. Also sometimes the messaging tone is not explicit in written messages. One has to be careful in what one writes to avoid any sort of misunderstanding.

As one can’t see the person on other end, that itself may cause misunderstanding. How about someone not answering you when you need one the most. What about when it happens often enough. It used to happen in one of our projects. Some people start leading their mind wires around and assume that maybe the guy on other side is ignoring knowingly. The reality may be entirely different. Whenever you have any negative feeling about collaboration, speak up. Give a call.

###Have mandatory chit-chat in the remote collaboration
Generally we have seen, remote communication is all business. Many people already discuss the context of the discussion in a chat and come to the point immediately in any remote voice conversation. After a period of time, that becomes very mechanical, technical and with no human touch. That’s not fun and not good for overall team.

Collocated environment can be entirely opposite. Lots of chit chat and transpires to time waste. We believe it’s important to have some amount of chit chat in the remote communication. It provides oil to the machinery of human collaboration.

###Define core hours of collaboration
People work in multiple time zones. Some adjustment from individuals in this context is mandatory for remote collaboration. It works well when team comes up with common core hours in which all team members are available to collaborate. Things are resolved faster that way.

###Culture of Appreciation 
Remote or collocated, team is a human institution. As mentioned earlier, in remote teams specially, softer aspects are even more important. Every individual wants to feel important as a matter of fact. Not sure why many of us are modest when it comes to appreciate someone’s efforts.

It’s important to have a culture of appreciation in remote teams.

###Egoism Kills Collaboration
When it comes to collaboration especially in remote pairing, it’s important to understand that it’s all about better and logical ideas and not about my idea or his idea. Egoism kills collaboration. It’s important to have culture of respect during remote collaboration.
