An investor once told me that virtually none of the startups that presented them as an investment opportunity to him
could explain where they got the estimation for the development costs in their business plan. At least not at a level
that inspires confidence.

In a typical scenario, when meeting with an investor, the entrepreneur with the idea doesn't have a technical co-founder
yet. This makes some sense, because [good developers][5] are [smart enough not to work for free][4]. This however puts
them in a bad position to [estimate development costs][1]. To fill this gap StarterSquad offers a service we call
Technical Feasibility Scan. Let me explain how it works.

##Technical Feasibility Scan to the Rescue

To mitigate technical implementation risks StarterSquad will:

- draw up a potential architecture
- [estimate the amount of work] [1]
- identify technical risks such as: scalability, complexity or need for rare skills
- create initial graphical designs to show to investors and launching customers

When investing in a new idea, there are business risks and technical risks. Financial investors ask founders to
scrutinize the business risks, but most [technical investors][2] are less experienced and fooled by the founders'
enthusiasm. An investor should not rely on the foundersâ€™ technical team to identify risks early.

Many early startups struggle with technical difficulties of implementing their idea. Many are
[forced to do a rewrite] [3] before they reach MVP. StarterSquad has the skills and experience to avoid this and
to reduce TTM with the lowest technical risk.

Technical risk is financial risk. It is better to aim at a good business opportunity with an inferior product,
than going for a non-opportunity with technical perfection. But, failing to deliver the technical minimum
will fail the whole venture. Most startups are focussing on technical propositions,
so mitigating technical risk is pivotal.
