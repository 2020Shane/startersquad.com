What are the top five priorities in your company right now? Most likely, they look something like this: growing your customer base, retaining your customers and driving revenue from your customers. As such, these priorities make perfect sense. But what if you could reach all three of these objectives by focusing on *happiness* as your single most important goal? According to Zappos’ Tony Hsieh, this approach can actually pay off. In his book, *["Delivering Happiness"](http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/160941280X),* Hsieh narrates his entrepreneurial exploits - from his failed childhood businesses to the 10+ years he’s spent building and leading Zappos, the highly successful online retailer acquired by Amazon in 2009. The book offers many valuable learnings, but ultimately it’s about how the pursuit of happiness can serve as the driver for your company’s growth. In this blog post, I will summarize some practical bits of advice found in the book which can help you embrace the search for happiness in your own company.

###1. Keeping your employees happy

In order to truly embrace happiness as a priority you must start by focusing on your team’s happiness. Money definitely plays a part in this (everybody welcomes a bonus now and then), but feeling like you’re all working towards a *shared mission* is more important. These are some things you can do to create this common sense of purpose:

* **Invest in your employees -** As Tony describes in his book, investing in your employees is crucial. At Zappos, employees have the opportunity to enroll in courses and training programs, they have a [shared library](http://www.zapposinsights.com/about/library-list) which serves as a knowledge and inspiration source, and they are encouraged to be themselves and stay creative.

* **Build a company culture -** This is one of the biggest takeaways you can gain from the Zappos story. A strong company culture is extremely important. Define a core set of values together with your employees and integrate these into your company’s fabric.

* **Hire people who fit with your company culture -** Once you’ve defined a set of values, these should determine whether new recruits will fit within the team. Make these values the guidelines for your hiring process and that way, you’ll be able to stay true to your company culture (see page 175 for more info on hiring at Zappos).

###2.  Keeping your customers happy

Zappos is praised for their unparalleled customer service. In fact, as Delivering Happiness tells us, it’s been their strongest USP and the basis for their success. What can you learn from them?

* **Customer service should be more than just a department -** A lot of companies want to minimize the costs associated with customer service. But as Hsieh would say, this leaves them with an "untapped opportunity." Great customer service can “result in word-of-mouth marketing” and even increase “the lifetime value of your customer” (page 165). To truly deliver great customer service, your entire company strategy needs to be revolve around it. Zappos, for instance, runs its warehouse 24/7 to get orders to customers as quickly as possible. While this is not the most efficient way to run a company’s warehouse operations, it contributes greatly to creating an amazing customer experience, as Hsieh describes throughout the book (see page 166).

* **Overdeliver -** Zappos has in many ways set a whole new standard for e-commerce customer service. They offer
free shipping (even for returns), they have a 365-day return policy, and they are far more approachable than the majority of online retailers. But they also go way out of their way to make customers happy. Read [this article](http://www.businessinsider.com/zappos-customer-service-crm-2012-1) and check out this [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/InfinitOInc/10-inspiring-zappos-customer-support-stories) and you’ll see what I mean.

###3. Keeping your partners happy

Keeping your partners and investors happy can be quite the challenge, but their happiness is just as important. Here’s what the Zappos story tells us about this:

* **Be transparent -** As described in the "Vendor Relations" section (pages 210 to 217) of the book, retailers tend to handle vendor relationships quite poorly, focusing on cost-cutting and aggressive negotiation. Buy-side and performance information is typically kept secret in order to get the most out of the vendors. Zappos took a different route, one driven by transparency and collaboration. The company created an “extranet” which gives vendors complete visibility into every aspect of their business - from inventory levels to profitability (see page 213). This led to increased trust and more willingness to collaborate on multiple aspects - from optimizing inventory levels to delivering the right marketing campaigns. In short, transparency creates a win-win scenario for all the stakeholders involved.

Happiness may be the last thing on your mind when you’re tasked with issues like scalability, fundraising and revenue creation. But if there’s one thing we can learn from Zappos is that striving for happiness can not only help you reach these goals, it can make the process much more interesting and enjoyable.
