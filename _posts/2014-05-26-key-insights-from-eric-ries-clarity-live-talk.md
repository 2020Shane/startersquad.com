It’s been more than five years since Eric Ries first developed the idea of the Lean Startup, and 3 years since the publication of his New York Times Bestseller. Today, his work has become a staple in every startup founder’s bookshelf. But the Lean Startup approach is not only popular among bootstrapping entrepreneurs. It has also been embraced by Fortune 500 companies and governments around the world. Favoring “experimentation over elaborate planning, customer feedback over intuition, and iterative design over traditional development,” the Lean methodology has become a new approach to management all together. Last week, I had a chance to hear Eric Ries speak during a live webinar organised by Dan Martell’s Clarity.fm. These were some of the most quotable insights he shared during the talk:

## 1. Don’t glorify failure, unless it serves a purpose

You know the saying, fail fast and fail often. It’s become a mantra among tech entrepreneurs. But when can you really afford to fail? In order for failure to be valuable in the long term, it must be productive. When it comes to your infrastructure, for instance, failure is not an option. When it comes to your strategy, you have to be willing to accept failure. Failure in the strategic sense is productive if you’ve either “learned something extremely valuable and managed to pivot to success; or dropped something because you realize that it’s not worth the time.”

##2. Ignorance is optional
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We live in a time where ignorance is choice. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23claritylive&amp;src=hash">#claritylive</a> Truth.</p>&mdash; danalparsons (@dlpyyt) <a href="https://twitter.com/dlpyyt/statuses/469531904791023618">May 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

Knowledge has never been as readily available as it is now. Finding answers is just a Google search or a Wikipedia link away. Today, ignorance is optional and it’s important to keep that in mind. Use the knowledge out there to foster a culture of learning in your organization.

##3. See your company as a startup, regardless of its size
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Looking at your business with a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23startup&amp;src=hash">#startup</a> lens helps you to be competitive. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23claritylive&amp;src=hash">#claritylive</a></p>&mdash; Laura Lilienthal (@lauralilienthal) <a href="https://twitter.com/lauralilienthal/statuses/469527283808497664">May 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

Being a startup, is being in a situation of extreme uncertainty. When you think about it, this situation is not that different for corporations. The conversations are the same. How can I bring this product to market faster? Will we meet our targets this year? How can I scale faster?
Corporations can learn a lot from the Lean Startup approach. Namely, they can embrace a new form of management to make faster decisions and innovate more rapidly. This brings me to the fourth point…

##4. Entrepreneurship is a function
According to Ries, entrepreneurship is a new corporate function. In other words, companies should use “startup” teams led by entrepreneurs to build new disruptive innovations. A key challenge of embracing this approach is also understanding that these entrepreneurs cannot be held accountable in ways that traditional managers would be. This means that for entrepreneurship to actually work within organizations, the organization must be willing to accept the possibility of failure. It must also go beyond traditional business crafts like modeling and prediction, and become comfortable with experimentation.
