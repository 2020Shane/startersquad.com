Recently I heard one definition of a startup as “a group of people working together to prove a business theory”. That’s an elegant definition, as it emphasizes the truth about a startup: there are no guarantees of success. Each day, an entrepreneur has to figure out how she’s going to create something out of nothing.
But that doesn’t help when you’re talking to anyone who isn’t an entrepreneur, and who doesn’t understand that basic modus operandi. If you’re trying to get funding, if you’re trying to get your first client, or even if you’re trying to explain what the heck you’re doing to your mother, you need to be able to prove what you’re doing is headed in the right direction. Since it frequently takes years to create a real business out of a startup, you need ways in the meantime to demonstrate success. And for that, you need success metrics.

It’s difficult to generalize about what the “right” success metrics are. Each startup is going to have a different measure of success. But my definition of the right success metric is the same for every business: it has to be one that demonstrates long-term business model validity. When I speak of long-term, I mean for more than a year.
So, what constitutes a wrong success metric? Eric Ries defines the wrong metric as a “vanity metric”: a number that goes up and to the right at the end of the graph, whether or not it leads to a sustainable, scalable business. Examples of wrong success metrics include the number of unique visits to a website (as opposed to a number which shows repeat visits or conversions to paying customers). Another one is paying customers. Yes, you read that right: customers who are willing to pay you in the pilot phase are not an indicator of long-term business success, they are merely early adopters. The money you make from them can pay the bills to get you to the next phase, but shouldn’t be a success metric. (In fact, they may be a failure metric, since they may keep you from a necessary pivot.)

How do you choose the correct success metric? In order to define that, you need to work on developing two pieces of information: 1) your long-term customer, and 2) your ideal business model. Even if you’re not able to target those people in that way in this phase. You should measure success based on moving in the direction of the real future business, not the startup you are now. Even if that goal changes in the short- to mid-term, it’s still a true success metric.
