What do you do in Amsterdam on a sunny weekend in summer? A BBQ in the park with some friends? Drive around on a
private boat all day? Some people go to the [Startup Weekend](http://pitch.rs/startupweekend-is-dead-long-live-startupweekend/).

I did too, and this is what I've learned.

##Share your ideas.
One of the speakers on Friday evening quoted ["Nobody's going to steal your stupid startup idea"](http://vimeo.com/24623147)
and added "Seriously. Do you really think anyone would drop what he's working on at the moment to start up with your idea? No, man."

The good thing about sharing is that you get customer validation for free. Which is especially valuable if you're
talking to experienced entrepreneurs who have already started more than one startup.

##Beer and party are winners.
"Make something with beer or party if you want to win!" claimed a participant who has attended all past
Amsterdam Startup Weekends. As it turned out, [he was right](https://twitter.com/swamsterdam/statuses/353957376841359360).

##Keep it simple.
This is nothing new but most people keep forgetting that less is more. Come up with one solution for one simple problem.
 During the weekend there's already a lot of chaos and confusion going on, so keep focussed on a clear business model.
 [Preparing helps](http://startupweekend.org/about/firsttimer/).

##Be a team player.
It's hard enough to build an efficient team from complete strangers within no time. But it's even harder to stand
egoists in the team. Stop them from stealing your motivation.

Let go of your compulsion to control, delegate. It's better to have a solid unfabulous MVP in the end than a perfect mess.

Get advice from the mentors but question funny statements like "You don't need to build a prototype, it's fair enough to
show product screenshots in the presentation". Hell no. Startup Weekend is about No Talk, All Action. The jury wants to
see a working MVP.

##Sell it right. Especially if you've screwed it up.
The whole weekend the teams were not only working on their project but they were pivoting or even changing the whole
idea, and more than one team split up completely. But no matter how much time you have to prepare, finally you have to
convince the critical experts of the jury.

One team managed to change their idea on Saturday night. Because they had only one day left they had to come up with
a rock-solid concept to be able to make an impact. On Sunday evening they presented CUBE. Order a luxury car of your
choice, make sure it's immaculate, then entrust it to them. They will make it into a cube. And later they will add other
shapes as options too.

 Awesomeness!

In our team we didn't manage to get it right. We noticed that on Sunday evening when we saw the first presentations
and heard the questions of the discerning jury. What to do? Giving up was not an option so we let
the stongest salesman in the team do the presentation, that saved our bacons.

##What would I do differently next time?
- Join a small team (max. 5 people, some will drop off anyway).
- Not pick a person who has already a finished concept for the pitched idea.
- Go for a beer or party idea? Probably.
