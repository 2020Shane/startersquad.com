One of the key tenets of the Lean Start-Up Methodology, and a piece of advice you hear
constantly, is “get out of the building and talk to your potential customers.” Obviously, this is an
important exercise to determine if anyone besides you thinks what you want to build is a good
idea. However, depending on what you’re asking them, people will not tell you the (complete)
truth most of the time. In other words, to quote Dr. House, “everybody lies”.
This is particularly true if the product you’re creating is in an area that people feel sensitive
about. This includes beauty and personal care, weight loss, and fitness, but can also include
things that people think they’re “supposed” to care about, like sustainability, green energy,
recycling, charity and good works, etc. With all of these topics, people will speak aspirationally:
meaning, they will make themselves look better than they are. “I work out 3 to 4 times a week”.
“Of course I recycle!” We all have said these types of things ourselves, when the real truth is very
different.
So, how can you get the truth out of potential customers? Here are some dos and don’ts:

**Do:**

- Ask about past behavior (“how many times last year did you go to a gym?”). For some
reason, we’re more willing to tell the truth about the past.
- Ask them what their biggest challenges are in the area of your product (“what makes
recycling difficult for you in your area?”).
- Ask them their biggest desire in this area (“what would you most like to achieve in the
area of fitness?”)
- Ask them about other habits and behaviors in this area (“do you read fitness magazines?”
or “do you pay your energy bill by direct deposit or do you ask to review your bill before
paying?”). You can frequently tell how truly invested they might be in a product just by
the habits they already have.
- Ask them how much they paid in the last year for products in your area (warning: they
may not be willing to answer you when it comes to money, but you can always ask).
- Let them try the product while you watch.
- Give them a gift for their time (something relevant to your business).
- Ask them for contact details to follow up: they potentially could become a pilot customer!

**Don’t:**

- Ask them leading questions to try to get a specific answer (“wouldn’t you work out more
often if you had a trainer at home?”)
- Ask them direct questions about current behavior (“how often do you work out?”, “do
you volunteer for charitable organizations?”).
- Ask them theoretical questions (“would you use a fitness trainer?”).
- Ask them how much they would pay for a product they haven’t seen or used.
- Ask them to pay money to you without delivering some kind of value.
- Take too much of their time, especially if they seem unwilling or probably not in your
target audience.
These tips will increase the likelihood that you will get real honest feedback you can use to
validate your ideas. And remember: involve (potential) customers early and often! Ongoing
dialogue with real people is the best way to ensure that you can pivot to stay on the right course.
