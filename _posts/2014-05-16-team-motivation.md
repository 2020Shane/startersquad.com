A couple of weeks back, I came across a great read on the science behind motivation. The [article](http://time.com/53748/how-to-motivate-people-4-steps-backed-by-science/), written
by Eric Barker for TIME Magazine, teased out 4 key things you should do to encourage people to do
their best at work: stop trying to bribe them with high salaries, address your employees’ feelings, focus
on progress and make them believe in your vision. Now these things may seem quite simple, but as with
many of these so-called best practices, they may be easier said than done. So, I decided to interview a
few startup founders to get some more hands on advice. I was especially interested in any day-to-day
activities, team habits, leadership techniques and management styles which may contribute to keep a
happy and motivated workforce. Here’s what they shared.

###Marcel Peters, Founder at [Bundles](http://www.wasbundles.nl), on keeping track of progress
“A very crucial formula to maintain a positive vibe in your company is to show the team commercial
results. Keep track of how many happy customers you have and how much money that generates for the
company. Share this openly somewhere in your office if need be, and make each team member realize
that they play a key role in your success too. Give each person a clear responsibility, a set task with a
clear link to your overall business goals. For example, generate X amount of leads or reduce the time
spent on an operational task by X percent. The importance of your business goals should be clear to
everyone within your company. Never try to motivate someone who deep down inside has doubts about
the realism of your business goals.”

###Rino Stevens, COO at [QwikSense](http://www.qwiksense.com/), on small things that matter
“Bonding is very important to keep your team motivated, no matter how large or how small. At
QwikSense, we take time to eat lunch together and almost every Friday we grab a drink after work. This
helps us unwind and talk about things in an informal setting. Another key thing to keep people motivated
is celebrating when you reach a milestone or accomplish something big. These celebratory moments are
crucial to maintain a positive team spirit.”

###[Peecho](http://www.peecho.com/) CEO Martijn Groot on knowing how to boost morale
“At Peecho, we make sure that we can all talk about our challenges and accomplishments during our
monthly developer dinners. Our dev dinners always always include a retrospective, where we take time
to discuss good and bad stuff from previous months; a time for demos, where everyone in the team can
show others the coolest things they’ve been working on; and of course some food and drinks. Sometimes
we also pair our dev dinners with a special activity, like a workout session or a rock climbing event.”
“If I were to give other startup founders advice on keeping teams motivated, I would say that humor
can work wonders to uplift team spirit. So don’t forget to tell a joke or two when your team is feeling
stressed. Show interest in people's personal situation, not just work-related matters, so you can manage
stress together. Be open about your goals and challenges and help people focus on stuff where they
can actually make a difference. And last, but definitely not least, celebrate your victories, no matter how
small!”

###[Springest](http://www.springest.nl/) Founder Ruben Timmerman on motivation and new ways of management
“We recently adopted Holacracy in our organization, a new and agile method for structuring and
organizing a company. Holacracy replaces the top-down predict-and-control paradigm with a new way of
achieving
control by distributing power over all team members. Within this structure everyone has his or her own
responsibilities. In Holacracy, all employees are accountable for and ‘manager’ of their own roles. All
tensions (the difference between the current situation and the way it should be) and issues serve as fuel
for continuously improving the organization. Nothing is to be swept under the table, everything can be -
and is - discussed within the team in effectively structured meetings. Everyone gets plenty of room to
express their thoughts and ideas there. This system gives a lot of power to all employees over their own
roles, but also helps them contribute to the improvement of our entire organization. The self-direction that
stems from this is very motivating.”
“We place a strong emphasis on transparency too. At Springest, we use Asana to keep track of every
project and task that is done within the team. This way, everyone can get their things done - GTD style
- and no one's work will go unnoticed.To stimulate the internal communications and keep everyone well
informed, we also use a tool to post updates and nice accomplishments achieved by the team. People
can comment on these updates, exchange information and show their engagement by liking each other’s
efforts there. On Fridays we’ve started to organize ‘town hall meetings’ too, where everyone can take the
stage to talk about their latest deployments or achievements in an informal setting. The transparency is
beneficial for individual motivation and the engagement increases positive energy.”
