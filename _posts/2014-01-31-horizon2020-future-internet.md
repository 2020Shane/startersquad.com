Today StarterSquad Founders Daan and Iwein packed their stuff and went to Brussels for the [Horizon 2020 event about
the Future of Internet](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/h2020-future-internet-call-1-all-you-need-know-one-info-day). Around 700 people from across the EU were present to discuss opportunities around the themes
Network Technologies, Software & Services Cloud, Net Innovation, and Experimental Platforms.

## How Horizon 2020 impacts the european Startup Scene

A total of 80 billion in funding is made available to transform dreams into reality. Three big priorities:
excellence in science, technical leadership, societal challenges. The good news is that the program is becoming
open and simpler for smaller companies. Also interesting is the stream in the program that provides access to
risk finance (debt & equity facility). So besides the traditional focus on fundamental research projects,
 a shift towards web entrepreneurship can be seen at the EU. Despite the fact that Skype and Spotify are great examples
  of European web entrepreneurship, the impact on FT500 level is limited. Here is where the ambition
  of Horizon2020 is interesting. Stimulate entrepreneurship and creation of European Internet Startups.

## Linking Startup Hubs to foster Web Entrepreneurship
We had Daan take a closer look at the 'web entrepreneurship' stream. The overarching aim of this program is to
stimulate web entrepreneurship in order to build Startups. Goals is to create Startups that have the potential
to reach FT500 stage. Some underlying objectives are creating employment, innovation & economic growth within the EU.
The audience here where people from incubators, accelerators, investors and some entrepreneurs. This was mainly aimed
at supporting events and platforms that support web entrepreneurship in the EU. The biggest issue is the fragmented
nature of web entrepreneurship support in the EU. Several Hubs, Incubators, Accelerators and Crowdfunding platforms
exist, but they have a country focus in many cases. This program is looking for pan-European initiatives in
building platforms and organizing events.

## Innovation in 'as a Services' and Cloud Computing
Iwein had a deep dive into the Software & Services (Cloud) stream of the program. The aim of this program is to forward innovation in
cloud platforms (ICT 7) and the tools and methods for software development (ICT 9).
Interesting themes were related to clouds of smaller devices, low power computing and meta clouds.
If some of these cloud initiatives get through, virtual hosting and developing for PaaS will be more feasible in europe, also
for startups that are required to stay away from US hosting parties due to Safe Harbor. There were several proposals for
cloud of clouds or meta cloud solutions. Here at StarterSquad we'll likely stick with pragmatism and [Prudentia](https://github.com/StarterSquad/prudentia) for now.

Interesting project to zoom into a little bit is [RUOTA (Robust User Oriented Test Automation)](https://www.facebook.com/pages/PROS/169705613078658). The need for better test
automation tools for non-developers is well identified and could dramatically improve software development as a whole.
If they can come up with something that beats the current clunky (and very expensive) tools that would be great
wouldn't it? Fingers crossed that they pull it off. There were also some Model Driven Development related proposals
and a proposal by IBM to automatically create mobile apps from legacy J2EE applications. Will they get acceptable
UX out of that? Iwein asked to have a statement related to the eating of his shoe stricken from the record,
just in case they do.

## StarterSquad Reflections
StarterSquad is ready and set to help realize the EU goals regarding the Future of Internet.
Our [distributed development team helping Startups](/team) to execute theirs ideas is spot on to realize EU's ideas.
We have seen some interesting developments and met some interesting people. We look forward to hook-up with
some of the initiatives we came across in the upcoming months and years. We sure feel the EU is shifting it's
innovation programs focus towards a stronger focus on creating and supporting Startups.
But, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating!
