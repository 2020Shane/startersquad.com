In continuation to [our last post](https://www.startersquad.com/blog/patterns-of-collaboration-in-distributed-organizations/) on remote collaboration patterns, let’s take a look on some key collaboration patterns for collocated teams which are helping many teams worldwide.

###How can I help you?
After working with many Agile projects, I realised that collaboration has deeper meaning in a widely used phrase, “How can I help you?”. 

How can I help in reaching towards your/our goals. How can I help in moving aside your road-blocks? How about when every team member is a part of this unspoken culture. The world will be nicer place to live in, won’t it? This definitely can be true for a team working together to begin with.

I feel these simple words should become part of default culture of the Agile teams and organisations. Wherever it became, the focus moved reaching towards “our” goals rather than “my” goals. 

###Swarming
Irrespective of whichever Agile framework you work with, how about having a team looking very busy, having a lot of items in “In Progress” column but nothing in DONE state. That is one of the natural repercussions in the teams where standup is used as status update meeting. 

One of the key tenets of Kanban is to reduce cycle time of user-stories, i.e. move user-stories to DONE column as soon as possible. “Stop starting, start finishing”, is the famous Mantra which needs to become anthem of every team.

Embracing this philosophy many teams have moved towards culture of Swarming. Instead of only one developer working on one user-story, in Swarming, multiple team-members focus in finishing user-story as soon as possible. 

Remember, swarming is not limited to certain ceremonies like standup but is a team culture.

###Pair Programming

The statistical figures are testimony to the fact that - high performance teams almost always pair on tasks. In reality, many candidates in Shu state (have a look at [Shu Ha Ri](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html) ) of their Agile journey do not hesitate in outrightly rejecting the pair programming approach altogether. 

The argument seems to be logical. Isn’t it a waste of effort or waste of so called “resources” in putting two persons for the same task? 

The fact is, pair programming is not just about pair of typists but much more. Any idea from where this whole idea of “evolutionary design” come from. A design which is well thought, evolving continuously, bare minimal but still done at the runtime. Pairing discussions help in moving towards evolutionary design. 

Apart from that, pairs don’t get distracted as a normal solo programmer does. It may be surprising to many people who never practiced pair programming but it’s entirely possible for any team member to resume any user-story at any point of time like a relay race member. No more hidden islands of knowledge. It’s entirely possible for key developers to move on to new projects rather than getting stuck in a project just because they are key team-members.

So it’s nobody’s guess that pairing is an important pattern for collocated as well as remote teams.

###Everybody is a Team Member
Collaboration prosper in environments with no hierarchy. I still see teams which evolve from deep hierarchical cultural background. Agile has no specific team roles and everybody works in generalist style. But in teams and cultures with hiearchical mindset, it’s not uncommon to see junior team members calling their seniors as sir, madam etc. Hierarchical mindset almost kills collaborative mindset.

Remember hierarchy has nothing to do with team culture only but has more to do with organisation culture.

###Team driven KPIs
During one of the presentations, one member from the audience told me a very interesting story. 

He said, “I worked in a team which followed all these cool ideas and principles of working together as team collaboratively etc. Personally speaking, they all make a lot of sense and work well for teams. Our team as well worked in close collaboration among developers and testers. The way we helped and supported each other, bugs count reduced tremendously. Everybody was happy. However when it came to performance appraisal, I got pulled by my manager just because of the same reason, the number of defects coming out of the project were very low. My KPI was driven on number of bugs extracted.” 

Doesn’t that sound shocking? Shocking that may be but in many organisations that’s the ground reality still. Teams move on to Agile but organisation somehow don’t. 

That may transpire into no real collaboration between team-members. Agile is a cultural change and can not be limited to just team change. It has more to do how entire organisation embrace these ideas. In this case, it’s important to have team-driven-KPIs instead of individual driven KPIs.

###Use Cardwalls
Many organizations in India work as outsourcing service companies. As most of the time customers sit in the US, Europe or other parts of the world, it becomes obvious to use electronic tools like Jira, Trello or Rally for transparently looking at team-progress. That’s important for the customers and makes a lot of sense.

However electronic tools are more like a Refrigerators, which you need to open and then look for relevant information. 

Frankly speaking, before I worked with as part of onshore customer team, I also never ever used or seen cardwalls working in real. An obvious question as well, why to have cardwalls when we already have electronic tools. 

However while working with physical cardwalls I realised the sheer importance of cardwalls. They significantly change the way team collaborate. Team-members have discussions around cardwall and standups start looking real. 

Team members move cards physically, people really understand what everybody is working on, standups don’t remain status update anymore but become sync-up forums. Standups also become shorter and team focuses on sprint progress as becomes evident from physical wall instead of just focusing on individual progress.

I hope you found this post useful. Please share your feedback as well as experiences which helped you to achieve better team collaboration.
