### Guest post by [Peter Ames][1]

One of the problems of starting a business is finding a suitable location. There are a whole host of office space options out there, you don’t want to be spending hours wading through these; life’s stressful enough! Peter Ames from Office Genie breaks down your choices to help you find the office that’s right for you.

###If you want your own space to shape as you want…
…then consider a traditional leased property on a long-term contract. You’ll have your own place to design as you see fit. This is also generally the cheapest way of renting office space (particularly if you’ve already got your own furniture).
However, you will have to manage the space yourself, which could be a lot of hassle – particularly for a small business without a dedicated office manager. It can also pay to be flexible when starting up; you never know where the market may take you. So the long-term contracts may not be particularly suitable for you.

###If you want the cheap flexible option…

…why not look at sharing another company’s office? For a single monthly fee your shared office will usually provide you with:

- A desk and a chair
- Broadband
- All utilities included in your monthly rent

In addition to having all this taken care of for you, and not having to worry about building maintenance, the real beauty of a shared office lies in its flexibility. Rolling month-to-month contracts mean you can get in and out quickly. This means, in a shared office, a business can test out office life, add more desks if things go well, or cut a few if they don’t. Even if you need to move location you can potentially up sticks at a mere month’s notice.
Shared offices can indeed be great. However you won’t have a huge amount of control over either the workspace (so you can’t decorate or change things such as broadband) or the people you’ll be working with. There are a couple of minor security concerns too: you won’t get to lock your own property at night and any data you send will being going through a shared network. If none of these sound like issues then what are you waiting for?

###If you want the full package…

…a serviced office might be right up your street. These business centres are specifically designed to provide top quality features for a number of businesses. You’ll usually get all the facilities you would in a shared office and many (if not all) of the following:

- IT support
- Reception areas and services
- Executive meeting and conference suites
- Business support

These are the most expensive option generally. However these highly professional, top-class centres could boost your business’ image while the high service level, and business support some space offer, could aid efficiency. So, if you’ve got the cash but haven’t really got the time, these could be the option for you. If you’d like to find out a bit more, why not check out [Office Genie’s guide to serviced offices][2]?
