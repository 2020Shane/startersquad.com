Estimating Risks
===============

In an enterprise, and especially a small one, the key to success is a healthy [Risk Return Ratio](). The game is to make smart investments of time, money or other resources so that the investments return. The key to a high *average* return on investment is to optimize the risk return ratio. This can be done in two ways:

1. maximizing the return
2. minimizing the risk

These days everybody focusses on maximizing returns of a single startup, but this is a short sighted strategy when
you're looking to make a good living as an entrepreneur or investor. Equal focus should be directed towards minimizing
 risk and maximizing return. Most success stories you read about are about often hard working, smart, but mostly
 lucky entrepreneurs. Winners of a particularly exciting lottery, where you can buy tickets by working 80h weeks. If
 you want better odds, and you don't need to be in the top 1000 of best entrepreneurs ever, there is a much better strategy.

People are notoriously bad at estimating risks. Way worse than at estimating *potential* return on investment. If this
wasn't the case, lotteries would make no money whatsoever. Well maybe they would make some money (more on this later),
but definitely much less.

How do you estimate a risk?
--------------------
Risk estimation is a matter of statistics. Insurance companies make a living out of estimating risks and they employ people who specialize in risk calculations. I'm very seriously considering hiring someone with those skills, but apparently insurance companies pay well to the employees that support their core business. And I'm naive enough to just do the calculations myself.

Let's take an example. Let's estimate the risk that I'll die in a car crash today. First, we have to split this events into parts. Particularly parts that we know, or can estimate. First we need to know how long I'll be driving and where and how tired I'll be and how busy the traffic. I'll drive my car from the train station to my home today of course there is also a chance that I'll forget about my car, or never make it back to the train station, but this chance is very low. I might also use the car to do some shopping, but I'm not sure yet. We can make a minute by minute list the chances of me being in a car, or even at higher precision. Then we can make a list of the chances of an accident at each stretch of the road. For each interval we multiply the chance of me being in a car with the chance of getting an accident at that bit of the road. We add up all those chances and we come to a number that is the total chance that I'll die in a car today. This is a bit tedious, especially if you have to go to second by second precision and calculate all possible speed variations and detours. The good news is that estimating at a lower resolution, doesn't reduce the precision of the outcome as much as the reduction in resolution. We can estimate the total time I'm in a car and from previous reports find the total chance of lethal accident per time unit. This will already give a rough idea.

Then if I know the risk, I can sensibly compare it to the return (10 minutes of my time), and I might decide to walk next time (I know a very safe walking route).

The basic recipe is to split risks into events that you can reasonably estimate, and then use basic statistics to calculate the total probability. Be sure to use math, and not your gut feeling to decide. Your gut can fool you, particularly when it comes to statistics.

What is my risk profile?
----------------
Ask yourself:

- What am I prepared to lose at a maximum?
- What is minimum return I need to feel succesful?

If you're prepared to lose a maximum of $10 and a maximum of 20 minutes, and you're only happy if you make a million; perhaps a lottery ticket is the best investment you can make. If you're willing to invest $1000 and your full time and attention for a year, then you might be more sensible trading derivatives. Most entrepreneurs don't feel that way. If you're honest with yourself, probably making a million in 10 years of hard work is a pretty good deal, especially if you're looking at doing work you enjoy. Having a potential of 10 times that might be very interesting, but if it doubles the chances of leaving empty handed, maybe it's not worth it.

With StarterSquad I'm looking for a model that gives a 50% return on investment per year, with the lowest possible risk. With a relatively small initial investment, you can get quite rich doing that. In fact you can turn $1 into a million in a career of doing just this. The coolest thing is, that if you spread risk well over smart angel investments, historically the *average* return on investment is higher than 50%. That's what incubators try to do.

With startups, 80% fail in the first 3 years. Only from that number it should be obviously clear that reducing the failure risk is a much better strategy for us than to increase the potential return by growth hacking. If I invest in one, the risk is 80%, two 64%, three 51%; when we reach 21 the risk drops below 1%. If I can lower the failure risk to 75% I only need 16 to get to that level.

Once the risk drops at least below 50% optimizing growth will become interesting again. But I won't hold my breath until that happens.
