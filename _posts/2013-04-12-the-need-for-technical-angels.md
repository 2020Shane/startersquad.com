When talking about angels in the context of startups, people naturally make the association with investors. This is
correct in some sense, but an angel does much more than financial backing alone. When a startup finds the right angel
they get mentoring and a deep knowledge of the market to support their enterprise.

In fact some angels don't invest a lot of money, but they invest much more time. Some even let themselves be payed for
the service in the form of a retainer, or even at an hourly rate.

These types of angel investors you could call *business angels*. There is another type of angel investment.
One that has been undervalued and received little attention so far. I'm referring to the *technical angels*:
experienced developers that help a startup build high quality technical solutions at low costs. This type of mentoring
could have effects just as positive as a monetary injection and mentoring on the business level.

Building a development team is an expensive and time consuming endeavor. Apart from hiring the right people, you need
time to chose a technology stack and time to let the team get their collaboration going. Investing this time and the money
for recruitment and wages can run up cost quite steeply. Up to a point where it is bootstrapping no more.

Not all startups begin with a team including technical people. And many of them shouldn't. Often you can run your business
in the beginning with little or no knowledge of technology, but there comes a point where you need to automate and scale.

This is where StarterSquad comes in.

In StarterSquad we have assembled some sharp young minds that thrive on learning new stuff. We enjoy specializing in the
most effective technologies to get software running fast today. We enjoy even more learning new technologies that fit
your business better than what we already know. We haven't forgotten the past either. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes,
php will kick node's ass and when that happens we're using php.

From what I've seen so far, a small technical edge can get a lot of business mileage, and, more grimly put, a small
technical setback can stop a business in its tracks. Having the experience on board to see these things for what they are
can be prohibitively expensive to a bootstrapping company, but not having it can be the end of them. I believe offering
this type of skills and a stable team that can wield them will give a competitive edge to many starting businesses,
and I'm determined to prove just that in the coming year.

Bring It On.
