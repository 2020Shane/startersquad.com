At StarterSquad I'm collaborating with a distributed community of freelance teams. Forming teams and matching development capacity to client projects isn't always a trivial exercise. Since I believe strongly in self organizing teams (and I'm a lazy manager), I've left it up to the members to do the organizing themselves. This used to happen in a generic chat room, but now that StarterSquad is getting bigger, we need to take it out of the noise. A few new people were introduced and since they didn't have an assignment yet, I decided to create a room for these introductions to happen by magic. What happened next was very intesting.

Looking for work?
-------

I named the room 'Looking for work?' which seemed somewhat sensible to me (I didn't give it much thought). Next thing people started advertising their skills. This shouldn't have been a surprise, but I didn't expect that to happen. Personally when I'm looking for work, I start with 'does anyone need help?' instead of 'I can do a handstand push-up. Who needs a handstand push-up done?'. I can actually do a handstand push-up, you know, and I think it's an awesome skill, but I have never been paid to do it (and I have no hope or desire that I ever will be). Then something even more interesting happened.

> true... I think without some some guideline […] this could look like a school playground where the new guys wait to be picked for the soccer teams

That was not the vibe I was looking for. Being introduced to a team should feel like a warm welcome, not a line-up. Oh boy, did I screw up…

Whenever I do something that doesn't have the desired effect, I try to take the heat off and then think about it for a while. You don't learn by hiding from your mistakes. Then one thing hit me, and to explain I'll share some statistics with you.

A recruiter told me he had 100 job openings for Java developers in NL, and on average around 2 candidates to offer against them at any given time. Similar numbers exist for AngularJS, Scala, Python, Test Automation, Growth Hacking all of which are skills represented in that group of people. For it to feel like waiting to be picked for the socker team there should be abundance of what you have to offer right? Apparently not.

Then I started thinking about the global software development market. It's growing like crazy, as it should. Just consider this. On average 1 in 6 people in the world owns a car. These people spend hundreds of euro's each month on a thing that they use on average for about an hour per day. These people spend on average way less than that on software. The value added to their lives by a car is way lower than the potential value added by software. In fact I use software to avoid using a car and I'm a much happier person for it. Therefore, the demand for software will eventually exceed the demand for cars in total market cap. Right now the software market is still significantly smaller than the car market. From a value perspective it should be an order of magnitude larger.

Given this, a scarce essential skill in a underdeveloped market, developers should *never* feel like they need to beg for a job. So why do many feel that way anyway?

I'm not an expert, but I've noticed that many of the best developers are humble. Humility is a great trait if you need to do precise creative work, because it naturally makes you second guess yourself. More importantly, it makes you open to the suggestion that you might have been wrong, and that happens often unexpectedly when building solutions to tricky problems. It's not so great for job negotiations.

This is a risk for the entrepreneur employing developers. If a developer feels undervalued and doesn't have the mandate that they deserve, they will look for another position. Your best people might be ready to leave and not comfortable asking you for what they deserve.

What's the solution? Simple, ask for help, instead of letting the experts beg for work. Obviously I should have named my room differently. It's now called 'Looking for help'
