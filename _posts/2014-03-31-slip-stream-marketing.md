Marketing is expensive, or time consuming. Or so you've heard. There are those that don't need to pay for it, like
certain cute kittens or others that have the luck to go viral. But for you it's expensive, or so you've been told.
But you've been told wrong. You can get more than enough attention without spending big on marketing. Not with
lucky virals, not with well orchestrated campaigns. You can use a thing that I call 'slipstream marketing'.
Let me tell you how it works.

## What is marketing traction anyway?
In essence startup marketing, like any kind of marketing, is about entering the thoughts of your target audience
in order to control them. This may sound manipulative (essentially it is), but it doesn't mean that it is bad or evil.
 I've been trying to manipulate people into consuming less energy and I'm manipulating my kids to eat less candy.
 This is also marketing. Entering the thoughts of others is done by exposing them to information that
 influences their behavior. One success factor is the quality of the impression you can make on someone.
 Another factor is the number of impressions you can make on someone. To have a long term effect on the human brain,
 repetition is much more important than the quality of a single impression. This can get rather theoretical -
 I'll try to leave most of that to the marketing experts (or for another post), but I need to expand on this a bit.
 If you repeat a message to someone, the time between repetitions is very important. If you wait too long,
 the effect of multiplication is lower, if you repeat too quickly you can annoy someone into disliking you.
 I hate Christian Leboutin for example because they (or someone abusing their brand) are spamming me.
 I have no clue what or who they are, but if they ever try to sell anything to me or someone near me
 I'll spit in their face with conviction. But back to the repetition.

To create mindshare, a hype, a vibe, traction or whatever you want to call it, you need to deliver your message
to the target audience a magical number of times. This magical number appears to be close to seven, although
it is likely that the number depends on the intelligence of the target audience and the delivery a lot too.
Too often isn't a problem (unless you really annoy someone, see the I hate Christian Leboutin example above).
But delivering the message requires resources and resources cost money. Unless you can hitch a ride with someone else.
If you're lucky enough to create a viral you're essentially hitching a ride on all the personal marketing that
the carriers of your virus do. But this is tricky, because to create an epidemic of an idea (which a viral is)
you need to have a message that is suitable to go viral. If your message is not suitable for a viral,
you're back to paying for ads. But there is another way.

## What is slip-stream marketing?
If you cannot go viral, this is typically because your idea is not catchy enough or your target audience is too small.
For example with StarterSquad our target audience is a subset of Startup Founders. Even a relatively small subset
I would say. This means our target audience is too small to create a viral. Targeting our audience with ads is hard
and expensive, so we've found a different way. We carefully monitor the marketing needs and strategies of our clients.
If they do something that has value for our target audience as well as theirs, we make some noise
about their marketing messages. We mention them on social media, share their stuff and link to their blogs,
website and other content. As a result many of the hits they get because they're a Startup
(and not because of what they are selling themselves) convert into hits on us. Pretty much for free.
In many cases our clients are very happy to help us with this, because advertising that they are backed by
a hardcore technical team makes them look good to partners and investors. But we could be a bit naughtier here
and go into the slipstream of someone without their permission. This strategy could also work for you if your
product or service is exclusive and you don't want to spend a large marketing budget on a shotgun approach.
Let me tell you how you can play the game to make this work for you.

## Create a stream, find your way
Before you can slip into a stream by tailgating someone else, you have to understand how the air flows.
Create a little stream of your own and see who is pulled into it. Once you have a message to send, you can experiment
with some social media tricks or a few adwords to get some vibe going. It's important to have some understanding
of how marketing around your target audience works. What are they reading? What are they talking about?
Listen carefully to the reactions you get: what do they think of your message, do they convert, why not?.
If you know what sort of messages work, you can work on the delivery mechanism. Thorough analysis and testing
are your friends here.

## Find a stream that flows your way
With over 6 billion people on this planet it's hard to find a cause that doesn't have a few hundred people behind it.
There is no reason to do something that's not entirely you. Find a handful of people that do what you'd like to be
doing and join them. I personally like innovation and high-end technical stuff. I think there should be
a green revolution. I think ownership is overrated and that commuting to work is ridiculous.
Now there are several likely streams that I can slip into. There are plenty of organisations that support startups
around green tech. Remote working is a common thing now. I'm sure you can find matching streams for your
specific service or product, if not, then doubt the sense of urgency of your value proposition.
Reach out to us and we can probably help you find the issue.

## Join the community and share
Instead of creating a wall of content of your own, replying to messages that you feel a connection with and connecting influencers in your network creates a buzz that very subtly pushes you up in the minds of the people involved
(its social media in the end). Find interesting messages and share them with people that you know will be interested
in them. Whenever you share things, you link yourself to the feeling people have about the thing you share.
Then when the time comes for the owner of that message that you shared to start a campaign, you can enforce the link
to you and get a lot of free marketing.

## Amplify other's campaigns
When someone is campaigning, they highly appreciate amplification. Blog, link, retweet and share. But not only
share stuff, you should add value and have an opinion of your own about the topic. When there is a lot of buzz,
people tend to be more likely to pick up on what you're saying, which in turn builds your audience.

Before you know it, you'll be able to reach a large audience, without spending a cent on marketing. Of course
the viability of this strategy highly depends on what value you put on your time. Time is a key and scarce resource
that is crucial for successful slipstream marketing. We've done quite a bit of slipstream marketing with StarterSquad.
I think it's a really fun way of interacting with our target audience and clients. And, if done well,
it is very rewarding. Let me know what you think about it!
