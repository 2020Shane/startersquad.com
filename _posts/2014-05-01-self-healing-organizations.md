The single most important driver for long term success is the ability of an organization to fix itself when it's
broken. Creating self-healing organizations is not trivial, but given some focus most organizations can increase their
self-healing abilities and their chances of success. Here are some things to watch over.

## 1. Feedback
Without feedback there is no learning. If there is no learning, there is no change in behavior. Make sure that you have
well determined cycles of feedback (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) in place and use them to flag and facilitate
necessary changes. From before the birth of StarterSquad we have had weekly Retrospectives, and it has brought me some
changes that were so unexpected that I even resisted them. I got straightened out and we're more successful for it.

## 2. Culture of fixing things
If something is broken, it should piss everybody off. That way if one stupid guy that happens to be the boss refuses
to fix it, the fix should come through anyway; either by consensus, or by cheating. You've heard the mantra: ask for
forgiveness, not permission. This can have some dangerous repercussions, but indeed taking a bit of risk without
mandate is on average more effective than signing everything off.

## 3. Trial and error, instead of only strategy
If you try something and fall on your face, you'll learn way more than mulling it over in endless strategy meetings.
Of course bad strategy is deadly, but most of you out there are way too scared to just experiment instead of
calculating the risks. A theoretically solid strategy has a chance to be bad too, and if it is,
everyone will fall back to what worked yesterday. This is how organizations get stuck.

## 4. If you can't beat it, burn it
If you see something happening over and over, and you have reason to believe it is suboptimal behavior, destroy the
means needed for this behavior. If, for example, there is no remote collaboration, burn the office (you can probably
find a more elegant alternative, like cancelling the lease).
 I'm a conflict adverse person, so this is the hardest one for me. I've succeeded a couple of times to root out
 suboptimal behavior like this, but I've got some scars to prove it's not an easy thing. However, if you leave
 suboptimal behavior around for people to fall back into when the going gets tough, eventually
 the self-healing powers of the organization will go away.

In nature, you can see the success of a species is determined not by it's awesome features (the coolest creatures are
 usually extinct). Instead it is determined by its ability to adapt to change. Fast feedback,
 either by high intelligence, or simply by growing fast, generally result in better adaptation. When you see cool
 things happening in nature they happen in a healthy ecosystem of humble bacteria, fungi,
 plants and insects. The same thing holds for organizations: if something really cool happens,
 it happens because of a lot of small and humble habits that the people in that organization hardly think about
 anymore. Like paying the bills on time, having fresh vegetables at lunch, wednesday morning code reviews,
 friday afternoon blog hour. Look around you, do you see some of these small habits? How did they grow? Any bad
 habits you should get rid of?
