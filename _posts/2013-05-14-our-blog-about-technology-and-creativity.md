## Technical Angels

When talking about angels in the context of startups, people naturally make the association with investors. This is
correct in some sense, but an angel does much more than financial backing alone. When a startup finds the right angel
they get mentoring and a deep knowledge of the market to support their enterprise.

In fact some angels don't invest a lot of money, but they invest much more time. Some even let themselves be payed for
the service in the form of a retainer, or even at an hourly rate.

These types of angel investors you could call *business angels*. There is another type of angel investment.
One that has been undervalued and received little attention so far. I'm referring to the *technical angels*:
experienced developers that help a startup build high quality technical solutions at low costs. This type of mentoring
could have effects just as positive as a monetary injection and mentoring on the business level.

Building a development team is an expensive and time consuming endeavor. Apart from hiring the right people, you need
time to chose a technology stack and time to let the team get their collaboration going. Investing this time and the money
for recruitment and wages can run up cost quite steeply. Up to a point where it is bootstrapping no more.

Not all startups begin with a team including technical people. And many of them shouldn't. Often you can run your business
in the beginning with little of no knowledge of technology, but there comes a point where you need to automate and scale.

This is where we come in.
