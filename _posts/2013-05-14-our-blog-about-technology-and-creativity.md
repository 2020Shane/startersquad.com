## Our blog about technology and creativity

The Earth was small, light blue, and so&nbsp;touchingly alone, our home that must be&nbsp;defended like a&nbsp;holy relic. For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective.

A&nbsp;Chinese tale tells of&nbsp;some men sent to&nbsp;harm a&nbsp;young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&rsquo;s how&nbsp;I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I&nbsp;could not help but love and cherish her.

Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969&nbsp;AD. We&nbsp;came in&nbsp;peace for all mankind.

For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we&nbsp;share in&nbsp;our world are far more valuable than those which divide&nbsp;us.

A&nbsp;Chinese tale tells of&nbsp;some men sent to&nbsp;harm a&nbsp;young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&rsquo;s how&nbsp;I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I&nbsp;could not help but love and cherish her.

Failure is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;option. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;enter the cosmos, to&nbsp;engage, single-handed, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unprecedented duel with nature&mdash;could one dream of&nbsp;anything more?

When I&nbsp;orbited the Earth in&nbsp;a&nbsp;spaceship, I&nbsp;saw for the first time how beautiful our planet&nbsp;is. Mankind, let&nbsp;us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy&nbsp;it! The regret on&nbsp;our side&nbsp;is, they used to&nbsp;say years ago, we&nbsp;are reading about you in&nbsp;science class. Now they say, we&nbsp;are reading about you in&nbsp;history class.

Spaceflights cannot be&nbsp;stopped. This is&nbsp;not the work of&nbsp;any one man or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;men. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;historical process which mankind is&nbsp;carrying out in&nbsp;accordance with the natural laws of&nbsp;human development.

It suddenly struck me&nbsp;that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I&nbsp;put up&nbsp;my&nbsp;thumb and shut one eye, and my&nbsp;thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t feel like a&nbsp;giant. I&nbsp;felt very, very small.

We want to&nbsp;explore. Look back over history, people have put their lives at&nbsp;stake to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out and explore. We&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;what we&rsquo;re doing. Now it&rsquo;s time to&nbsp;go.
