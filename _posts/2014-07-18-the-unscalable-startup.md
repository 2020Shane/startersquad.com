150 years ago, everybody was working from home, and everybody was an entrepreneur. Not everything was easy, but if you made a living, you were most probably doing it with a small local business. Then the industrial revolution happened, from that point we invented commutes, workplaces and enterprises.

Now most of us commute to the office every day, but since the internet, this has really become silly. I've been questioning myself since early in my career why we would take tonnes of steel to work every day. I think the solution is in becoming entrepreneurs again, and I think that many of the entrepreneurs working with StarterSquad are good examples of how this might work, but why isn't everyone being an entrepreneur then? I have seen Startup ideas die because of the following reasons:
    
- It doesn't scale
- There is already someone doing that
- It isn't profitable enough
- I'll never get an investor

Why is scalability important? Why is it a problem if there is competition? Why do you need to make a profit? Why do you need an investor? Interesting questions aren't they? What if you could make enough money to sustain living a happy life without all that, wouldn't that be great?

I predict a revolution in start-ups that don't scale. Being a billionaire seems great, but what if you are an unhappy billionaire? Wouldn't you rather be exceptionally happy with an average income?

## It's been happening for a while

There are more web shops and small internet businesses than you can count. Let's have a story about one:

Our family bought a picnic table recently. Hand made from pine trees, a nice piece of art and not very expensive at all. Somewhat to my surprise the CEO of the picnic table company came to deliver it on Saturday morning with his 7 year old son, both grinning from ear to ear when stepping out of their van. I helped them assemble the table and then set them down for coffee and cake as we do in the Netherlands. He told me he was selling hundreds of those tables per year, and a couple of other items of his handiwork, but he had no employees and was doing everything with his family. So are you very busy? I asked -Yes, but not too busy, he says. Would you sell more with an employee? -No thanks, I'm happy the way it is. There is probably a multi billion market for decent outdoor furniture waiting for him in europe, but he just doesn't care. Sad isn't it? But wait, he's happy, he's having coffee on saturday morning with his son and a happy customer. That's not so bad isn't it? What would his life look like if he took the European market for outdoor furniture you think?

## what you should really be asking?

Let's have a look at another story.

One of my friends was working in an IT company, getting enough money and was serving on top jobs. Somewhere down the line, he began to question if  he need or want to continue living in a mechanical way. Would there be alternatives with which he could survive but at the same time do what he wanted to do in his life? 

One fine day, he left his job and started working as independent coach and consultant for the organizations along with one of his friends. That worked well and he started getting enough work. However, down the line, he stumbled with a question on scalability. During that time, he had a conversation with me.  He asked how should he scale the business further. He said, "I am not able to find the right people who work with the similar quality I work with. Also I don't want to compromise on quality. However at the same time I feel guilty when I am not able to serve our potential customers because of lack of bandwidth. 

In response, I asked a question to him. I said, " What do you really want? Do you want to go back to that mechanical phase of your life or would like to live the life you are living right now, i.e. live your life with enough money and do other things in your life". It looked like that he got an answer for that time. Further, he moved to a place which he felt was good for him and his family. By definition people chose place based on where their work is. He did it other way round. He chose a place where he want to live and then identify what he could do. In the current age we live in, where start-ups and internet prosper together, 
it's easy to do compared to the days where you had to go to factories to get some work.

Let's start with the questions you should ask:

- What do you want exactly? 
- Are you really going to measure your success by the success of your stakeholders? 
- How far will you let the needs of your business impact the way you're living now?

Based on the answers you'll be able to deduce things like what you need in terms of income, how much time will you spend each day at a maximum, how much risk you can take. Those are the primary factors that should impact the way you structure your business. 

Let's say you enjoy making things by hand ("doesn't scale", "you should automate", "you should outsource to China"). That's fine, you start making a few things by hand. Let's say you like to sell at a price point where you don't feel bad talking to customers ("It's worth more", "customers are prepared to pay more", "you should monetize") and let's say that you also like to make a personal delivery to the customer ("distracting", "primary focus", "core business", "someone can do that cheaper"). Then you just have your small 2ppl business, rent a barn and do it the way you want. If you need some small bit of automation, for example because you don't like to deal with customers over the phone, then you just automate that and make your life easy.

Let me just say it: _it's OK not to scale_. Stop being ashamed for not chaining yourself to an investor. For not 
monetizing on your user base. It's OK to be small, it might actually be better.

I think there is something inherently satisfying about doing the things you like the way you like them and not be buggered by all the noise out there, like the most hilarious one I heard: "If it doesn't scale, it is, by definition, not a startup". Who cares anyway? As a supplier, it is also satisfying to work for clients that are not growth hacking. They focus on real things, small steps. What can we do in a week part-time? There is less money in it of course, but in the end that's not so important. I like small projects that solve real problems.
